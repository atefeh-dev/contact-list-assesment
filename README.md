# :performing_arts: Contact List Web Application

## :rocket: [Live DEMO](https://silver-pie-abe8f1.netlify.app)

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Behavior

- Upon loading the home page, a blinking smile appears.
- The contacts grouped in the tabs.
- You can view a contact's card by clicking on it.
- Clicking on the close button of a card causes it to disappear.
- Whenever another contact is clicked, the first clicked contact card disappears.
- Mobile-friendly `in mobile, tab is scrollable`
- When the API server is down for any reason, you will receive an error message and should try again.

## :writing_hand: As a Next Step, I would like to suggest

- Pagination by scrolling.
- Right-to-left support.
- You can search for a user by typing in their name.
- Support dark Mode.
